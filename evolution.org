*** Assignment
**** Name three issues why Fortune 100 firm executives (i.e., big Business from the Marketplace Landscape map) care about the medical industry.

Three potential medical industry issues of concern for Fortune 100 business include 1) healthcare payment reform, 2) rapidly advancing medical technology, and 3) rising pharmaceutical cost. All three of these issues can affect employer cost for employee health care. This can be in the form of employer insurance or contracts with private insurance coverage. These issues can also impact employee recruitment and retention as companies compete for talent. Both payment reform and advancing tech have the potential to increase the cost for an employer as does uncontrolled or increasing subsidized medication cost.   

**** What are two market conditions or regulations that could affect the issues? Describe and explain.

Medical technology reliance in our culture and an aging population present specific challenges for the issues raised in the first question. Our reliance and preference for a technical solution for health conditions creates a direct link to rising tech cost and corporate/individual experienced medical cost. This reliance also dilutes our motivation to seek healthy behaviors over a technical solution. The fact that our population is aging while our fertility rates are decreasing creates increased pressures on the health care system. These pressures will likely be realized in increased needs to impose utilization management and resource allocation. Limited resources will not only be in the form of tangibles such as medications and access to care but also lower numbers of a younger generation of health care providers.

**** In what way might the three issues (that you identify in #1) diminish or not in the next five years? Why and how? To what extent? In what way? etc. Describe and explain for each.

The three issues raised in question #1 are unlikely to diminish. The health care payment system has become untenable and already experiments with ACOs, bundled payments and other forms of novel contracting are proceeding. The early data does not identify a clear path forward but it is clear that the current model is no longer working. Technology innovation is moving forward at a rapid pace. Some of the technologies have resulted in gains for patients and providers towards better outcomes with greater efficiencies in health care delivery. However, innovations in technology have also created challenges. We now have an expanding reliance on data and the clinical intelligence it can provide. However, we have not figured out how to manage the vast amounts of this clinical data and more significantly how to develop user interfaces to empower providers to meaningfully interact with clinical data. Lastly, pharmaceutical cost remain largely uncontrolled. While the rising cost of drugs have been in the news throughout 2016 there remains an opportunity to enact controls to cap cost growth and even re-envision the cost of drug R&D and the compensation to companies making the investment.

* Week 2: Health Care Delivery Evolution
** Provider Market Overview
   - Physicians set tone for much of healthcare
   - Johns Hopkins in MD sets the tone for med profession in training of MDs
     - 4 yr bach degree and then advanced 2yr basic and 2yr practical
     - started modern med edu model
     - now in 21st century with advanced tech, physicains still in charge
   - Monopolies do allow for substitues or alternatives
   - Barriers to entry
     - legal ones are public franchise
     - exclusive control of franchise
     - Government license contols entry
     - patents and copyrights
   - Natural barrier
     - economies of scale
   - Price discrimination
     - set prices, sale same good at different price based on what markets can bear, academic rate, corporate
   - Single Price Monopoly
     - same price for each unit sold
   - Price discriminations
     - example: HCA charges less for health care based on geographic location
     - but acceptable due to local cost of providing care
     - attempt by a monopoly to capture consumer surplus
     - Price and quantity  is consumer surplus. Market price is value of good minus price paid for it
     - Other forms
       - bulk pricing
       - by individual by what willingness based on time, location, demand
       - between groups such as medicare, medicaid, private insr

     - firms must be able to identify different demand groups
** Price Discrimination in Practice
   - Example
     - one price per visit
     - some people cannot afford set price
     - establish demand curve for groups with/without insr
     - graph P & Q curves
     - discriminating for price will increase volume and profit
       - overall

     - Insurers demand FFS but providers hate FFS
     - Insur want data from EMR but provider want PFPorformance
     - Ends up back to FFS
     - uncertain future for ACO
     - must have EMR and Claims data if ACO is to work

*** Final Quiz
* Week 3: Insurance Market
** What is Health Insurance
*** Overview
   - is not cash bases unlike some other countries
     - even in other countries there is a migration to insurance
   - Types
     - FFS (fee for service) BCBS
     - HMO: Kaiser
     - Medicare & Medicaid
     - ACA
*** Risky Business
    - making decisions under uncertainty
    - Risk
      - probability of 0-1 of good vs. bad
      - estimates allow predictions
    - Cost of risk
      - some are risk takers
      - consider behaviors and associated risk
      - depends on access, age, money
*** Utility of Wealth
    - Given an individual measure wealth vs. Utility (hapiness)
      - curve increases with wealth but flattens after $3,000 per month
      - people value things more at lower levels of income
    - Translating utility to Expected Utility (EU)
      - avg set of outcomes
    - Choices Under Uncertainty
      - compare choices and resulting income with expected utility
      - higher risk creates risk aversion
      - flattening utility curve makes risk aversion past higher incomes
    - Risk Aversion
      - amount willing to be traded for marginal income increase
    - Risk Neutrality
      - utility is same for any income
    - Reduce risk
      - insurance can reduce risk but cost an insurance premium
      - insurance takes risk
      - consumer's income not expoosed if risk is covered by insurer
*** How Does Insurance Work
    - Pooling risk
      - pool collective risk
      - some will pay more than they need to in order to avoid risk
      - uncertainty of 0-1
      - going from 10 -> 9 income then max cost of insurance is 1K
      - value in this case is variable based on individual
      - insurance attempts to cost insurance with profit above minimum cost
*** Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection
    - individuals prefer to keep healthcare information private
    - restriction of health information can create a risk
    - Moral Hazard
      - one or more of two parties with agreement has incentive to bring benefit to themselves at the cost of another
      - for example an individual may not disclose health conditions to insurance company and risk assumed by company was not properly predicted/costed
	- could lead to insurance company failing and every insured life not getting coverage
      - Adverse Selection
	- lack of full disclosure
	- enter into agreements without full disclosure but not planning to use system or take advantage
	- mitigate risk
	- insured people have fewer incentives to avoid loss
	- companies mitigate risk by reviewing health hx, age, gender, predictive actuary tables
	- Review signals that indicate decernable risk
	  - cost insurance appropriately to assume risk for avg of all insured lifes
